  - bring 32oz Ekert's Farm Kentucky Honey, 12oz Meijer Mexican Orange Blossom Honey, and 1gal distilled water + coffeewater mineral packet to a boil
  - cover and allow to cool to 98F
  - measured 154 fl oz remaining
  - add 2.4g rehydrated Lalvin EC-1118 champagne yeast
  - specific gravity = 1.083
  - ferment in a 2 gallon container with an airlock filled with titos vodka
- 2025-06-11
  - specific gravity = 1.051 (4.2%)
  - specific gravity of water = 0.983
  - percentage of honey (vol) = 26/154=16.883%
  - effective starting specific gravity of honey -> 26/154*x + 128/154*0.983 = 1.083 -> x = 1.575
  - specific gravity of ethanol = 0.7937
  - ending specific gravity -> sg_w*r_w + sg_h*r_h + sg_e*r_e -> 0.983*128/154 + 1.575*(26-k)/154 + 0.7937*k/154 = 1.051
  - k = 6.468 (measured <- 0.042*154)?
  - 1.051*154 - 0.983*128 - 1.575*26 = -0.7813*k
  - k = 6.297 (calculated)
  - diff is due to evaporation of ~0.1 fl oz of liquid over the time period - it can be ignored
  - remaining honey = 26-k = 19.5 fl oz
  - require 7.5oz honey to bottle condition
  - density of honey = 1.4 g/ml = 0.049384 oz/ml = 0.049384 oz / 0.0338140227 floz = 1.46 oz / floz
  - 7.5 oz -> 7.5 / 1.46 = 5.14 fl oz remaining -> desired k = 21.9 -> sg_bottle = 0.972
  - alternate (measured) density of honey = 1.575*0.983 = 1.548225 g/ml = 0.054612 oz/ml = 1.62 oz / floz
  - 7.5 oz -> 7.5 / 1.62 = 4.63 fl oz remaining -> desired k = 22.4 -> sg_bottle = 0.969
  - difference in vol_co2 between measured density of honey and sourced density of honey is ~0.2 - it can be ignored
- 2025-06-25
  - specific gravity = 1.021 (8.1%) 
  - estimated time to sg=0.972 ~3weeks
  - decided to bottle early and then crash out the yeast after 2 weeks, which should yield ~4 volumes of CO2
